# CandidateProject
This project is a candidates' home test that I decided to publish as a part of an interview I was in.

- Embedded map
- Find places nearby (UI Markers)
- Reverse geocoding (from coordinate to address)
- Address search with autocomplete

Other stuff:
- Storyboard
- Auto Layouts (constraints)
- CocoaPods
- Open source component
- UIView animations
- Delegates
- Blocks
- Web requests
- Categories

Enjoy :P
